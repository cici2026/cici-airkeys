//! What the core asks of the world, and what the world tells the core.
//!
//! - [`Request`]: performed by the platform shell (Swift, Kotlin) — the camera and the screen.
//!   Every request is a notification: the core never waits for an answer.
//! - [`CodeOp`]: performed by the Rust runtime — Lumen Code send and receive. No platform
//!   shell sees these.
//! - [`Action`]: what a person did, or what happened to the app.
//!
//! There is no storage and no randomness here, by design: Airkeys never creates a recovery
//! phrase and never writes one down. The person brings their phrase each session; it lives
//! in the app's memory until they close the wallet or the app is closed.
